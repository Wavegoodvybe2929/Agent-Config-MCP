## Performance & Scalability Considerations

### 1. Database Optimization
```sql
-- Optimized SQLite Configuration
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;          -- Write-Ahead Logging for concurrency
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;        -- Balance safety and performance
PRAGMA cache_size = 10000;          -- 40MB cache for better performance
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;         -- Temporary tables in memory
PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456;       -- Memory-mapped I/O for large databases
```

### 2. Memory Management
```python
# Memory optimization strategies
- Connection pooling: SQLite connection reuse
- Object pools: Reuse expensive objects
- Lazy loading: Load data only when needed
- Batch operations: Group database operations
- Async I/O: Non-blocking file and network operations
```

### 3. Concurrency Patterns
```python
# Async concurrency patterns
- Producer/Consumer: Task queue processing
- Fan-out/Fan-in: Parallel agent coordination
- Circuit Breaker: Fault tolerance for agent failures
- Rate Limiting: Prevent resource exhaustion
- Backpressure: Handle overload gracefully
```

## Security & Compliance Stack

### 1. Security Measures
```yaml
Input Validation:
  - pydantic: Schema validation for all inputs
  - jsonschema: JSON message validation
  - Sanitization: SQL injection prevention

Authentication & Authorization:
  - No external auth required (MCP handles this)
  - Internal: Agent capability-based access control
  - Audit logging: All operations logged for review

Data Protection:
  - Encryption at rest: SQLite encryption extension (optional)
  - Secure communication: MCP protocol handles transport security
  - Data minimization: Only store necessary information
```

### 2. Compliance & Auditing
```yaml
Logging & Audit:
  - All agent actions logged with timestamps
  - Decision trails for consensus building
  - Knowledge source attribution
  - Performance metrics tracking

Privacy:
