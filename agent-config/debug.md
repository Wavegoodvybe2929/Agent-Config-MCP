## Debugging Methodology

### 1. Systematic Investigation Process

```python
# Debug investigation framework
class DebugInvestigation:
    def __init__(self, issue_description: str):
        self.issue = issue_description
        self.evidence = []
        self.hypotheses = []
        self.root_cause = None
    
    def gather_evidence(self):
        """Collect all available evidence"""
        # Log analysis
        self.analyze_logs()
        
        # Error reproduction
        self.reproduce_issue()
        
        # System state examination
        self.examine_system_state()
    
    def formulate_hypotheses(self):
        """Generate possible root causes"""
        # Based on evidence patterns
        # Consider known issue patterns
        # Apply domain knowledge
        pass
    
    def test_hypotheses(self):
        """Systematically test each hypothesis"""
        for hypothesis in self.hypotheses:
            if self.validate_hypothesis(hypothesis):
                self.root_cause = hypothesis
                break
    
    def implement_resolution(self):
        """Work with other specialists to resolve"""
        # Coordinate with appropriate specialist
        # Implement fix
        # Validate resolution
        pass
```

### 2. MCP-Specific Debugging Tools

```python
# MCP protocol debugging utilities
async def debug_mcp_message_flow(server):
    """Debug MCP message handling"""
    # Enable message tracing
    server.enable_message_tracing()
    
    # Test message flow
    test_messages = [
        {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {}, "id": 1},
        {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "params": {}, "id": 2},
        {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "resources/list", "params": {}, "id": 3}
    ]
    
    for message in test_messages:
        try:
            response = await server.handle_message(message)
            print(f"Message: {message} -> Response: {response}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error handling message {message}: {e}")
            import traceback
            traceback.print_exc()

def debug_swarm_coordination():
    """Debug swarm intelligence coordination"""
    from mcp_swarm.swarm import SwarmCoordinator
    
    coordinator = SwarmCoordinator()
    
    # Test agent assignment
    task = {"type": "test", "complexity": 0.5}
    try:
        assignment = coordinator.assign_optimal_agent(task)
        print(f"Assignment successful: {assignment}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Assignment failed: {e}")
        # Investigate assignment algorithm
        coordinator.debug_assignment_process(task)

def debug_memory_system():
    """Debug persistent memory system"""
    from mcp_swarm.memory import PersistentMemory
    
    memory = PersistentMemory("debug.db")
    
    # Test basic operations
    try:
        # Test connection
        conn = memory.get_connection()
        print(f"Database connection: {conn}")
        
        # Test storage
        knowledge_id = memory.store_knowledge("debug", "test_data")
        print(f"Storage successful: {knowledge_id}")
        
        # Test retrieval
        data = memory.retrieve_knowledge(knowledge_id)
        print(f"Retrieval successful: {data}")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Memory system error: {e}")
        # Investigate database schema and operations
        memory.debug_database_state()
```

### 3. Error Pattern Analysis

```python
# Common error patterns and solutions
ERROR_PATTERNS = {
    "mcp_protocol": {
        "json_rpc_invalid": "Check message format and required fields",
        "tool_not_found": "Verify tool registration and name matching",
        "resource_access_denied": "Check resource permissions and URI validity"
    },
    "swarm_intelligence": {
        "convergence_failure": "Check algorithm parameters and iteration limits",
        "agent_assignment_timeout": "Investigate agent availability and load balancing",
        "consensus_deadlock": "Check voting mechanisms and timeout settings"
    },
    "memory_system": {
        "database_locked": "Check concurrent access patterns and transaction handling",
        "connection_timeout": "Investigate connection pooling and database load",
        "data_corruption": "Check transaction integrity and backup procedures"
    }
}

def analyze_error_pattern(error_message: str, component: str) -> str:
    """Analyze error message and provide debugging guidance"""
    patterns = ERROR_PATTERNS.get(component, {})
    
    for pattern, guidance in patterns.items():
        if pattern.lower() in error_message.lower():
            return f"Pattern detected: {pattern} - {guidance}"
    
    return "Unknown error pattern - requires manual investigation"
```

3. **Quick Fix Assessment**: Determine if temporary workaround is possible
4. **Specialist Coordination**: Engage appropriate specialists for resolution
5. **Resolution Validation**: Verify fix effectiveness and prevent regression

### Debugging Quality Standards
- All debugging sessions must be documented with evidence
- Root cause analysis must be thorough and verifiable
- Resolutions must include prevention measures
- Knowledge must be shared to prevent similar issues

This debugging framework ensures systematic and effective problem resolution for the MCP Swarm Intelligence Server while maintaining high standards for investigation and resolution quality.
