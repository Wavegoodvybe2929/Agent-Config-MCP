## Agent Hooks Integration with Orchestrator

The agent hooks system integrates seamlessly with the orchestrator-driven workflow to provide automated quality gates, coordination, and continuous improvement for MCP development:

### 1. **Orchestrator Hook Coordination**
- The orchestrator triggers appropriate hooks based on task lifecycle events
- Hook results influence orchestrator decisions and agent assignments
- Failed hooks can trigger automatic remediation or escalation

### 2. **Swarm Intelligence Hook Integration**
- Hooks capture coordination patterns and success metrics
- Swarm algorithms learn from hook execution history
- Optimization cycles use hook data to improve agent assignment

### 3. **Memory System Hook Integration**
- Hooks persist successful patterns and learned knowledge
- Memory system provides context for hook execution decisions
- Knowledge base updates inform hook behavior and validation criteria

This comprehensive agent hooks system ensures that the MCP Swarm Intelligence Server maintains high quality, continuous improvement, and automated coordination throughout the development process, supporting the orchestrator-driven workflow with intelligent automation and validation.
