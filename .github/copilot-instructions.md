# MCP Swarm Intelligence Server Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

MCP Swarm Intelligence Server is a high-performance implementation of collective intelligence for multi-agent coordination featuring agent ecosystem management, hive mind knowledge bases, persistent memory systems, automated workflow orchestration.

## Agent Configuration System - Orchestrator-Driven Multi-Agent Workflow

This project uses the EXACT SAME agent configuration system as proven in BitNet-Rust, adapted for MCP development. **THE ORCHESTRATOR IS THE CENTRAL COMMAND** that routes all work and manages all specialist coordination with enhanced swarm intelligence and persistent memory capabilities.

### ðŸŽ¯ MANDATORY ORCHESTRATOR-FIRST WORKFLOW

**ALWAYS START WITH THE ORCHESTRATOR** - This is non-negotiable for any development work:

#### **Step 1: ORCHESTRATOR CONSULTATION (REQUIRED)**
Before doing ANY work, **ALWAYS read `agent-config/orchestrator.md` FIRST** to:
- **Understand current project context** and MCP development priorities
- **Get proper task routing** to appropriate MCP specialist agents
- **Identify multi-agent coordination needs** for complex MCP features
- **Access workflow management** and quality gate requirements
- **Integrate with agent hooks system** for automated lifecycle management

#### **Step 2: ORCHESTRATOR ROUTING DECISION**
The orchestrator will route you to appropriate specialists using this framework:
- **Primary Agent Selection**: Based on task domain and complexity
- **Secondary Agent Coordination**: For cross-domain or complex requirements
- **Quality Gate Assignment**: Validation and review requirements
- **Workflow Coordination**: Timeline and dependency management

#### **Step 3: SPECIALIST CONSULTATION (ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDED)**
After orchestrator routing, consult the specific specialist agents identified:
- **Read specialist agent configs** for domain-specific context and expertise
- **Understand agent intersections** and collaboration patterns
- **Follow established workflows** and handoff procedures
- **Maintain orchestrator coordination** throughout the work

### Agent-Config Integration

The MCP server integrates seamlessly with the agent-config system:

- **Automatic Tool Discovery**: MCP tools are automatically discovered from 17 agent configurations
- **Orchestrator Coordination**: All MCP tool execution routes through orchestrator workflow management
- **Quality Gates**: Agent-defined quality standards apply to all MCP tool operations
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Complex MCP operations coordinate multiple specialist agents

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns (Orchestrator-Managed)

The orchestrator manages several coordination patterns for different task types:

#### **Single-Agent Tasks (Orchestrator Oversight)**
```
Simple tasks â†’ Primary specialist + orchestrator coordination
Quality validation â†’ truth_validator.md review
Documentation â†’ documentation_writer.md if user-facing
```

#### **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Orchestrator Coordination)**
```
Complex features â†’ Primary + Secondary specialists + orchestrator management
Cross-domain tasks â†’ Multiple specialists + daily sync + orchestrator coordination
Critical changes â†’ Full review chain + architect + security + orchestrator validation
```

#### **Emergency Response (Orchestrator Escalation)**
```
Critical issues â†’ Immediate escalation + orchestrator resource coordination
```

## Current Priority (Development Phase)

**ðŸŽ¯ Development Phase**: MCP server development with swarm intelligence capabilities
- **Orchestrator Routing**: As defined in orchestrator.md workflow matrix
- **Goal**: Complete automated project scaffolding with memory/swarm components
- **Key Tasks**: Project structure, agent config deployment, CI/CD pipeline
- **Timeline**: 30 hours across current phase

## Workflow Rules - Orchestrator-Driven

1. **ðŸŽ¯ ALWAYS START WITH ORCHESTRATOR** - Read `orchestrator.md` first for every task
2. **Follow orchestrator routing** - Use the orchestrator's agent selection matrix
3. **Maintain orchestrator coordination** - Keep orchestrator informed of progress and handoffs
4. **Respect agent intersections** - Follow established collaboration patterns between agents
5. **Use quality gates** - Apply orchestrator-defined validation requirements
6. **Follow current phase** - Align with COMPREHENSIVE_TODO.md priorities as managed by orchestrator
7. **Execute user requests exactly** - Within the orchestrator's workflow framework
8. **Stop when complete** - When orchestrator-defined success criteria are met
9. **Be direct and clear** - Provide straightforward responses following orchestrator guidance
10. **Use available tools** - Leverage tools efficiently within orchestrator's workflow framework

## When to Stop - Orchestrator-Defined Criteria

- Task completed successfully according to orchestrator quality gates
- User request fulfilled within orchestrator workflow context
- No further action required as determined by orchestrator coordination
- Clear completion criteria from orchestrator workflow met
- Current phase priorities defined by orchestrator respected
